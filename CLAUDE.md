# CLM - AI Assistant Guide

Session-start orientation for AI assistants working on the CLM (Coding-Academy
Lecture Manager eXperimental) codebase. This file holds only the information
you cannot discover cheaply from the code, a single doc lookup, or
`clm info`. Everything else is in its canonical home — see the
**Documentation Map** below.

## Project Overview

**CLM** converts educational materials (Jupyter notebooks, PlantUML diagrams,
Draw.io diagrams) into multiple output formats (HTML slides, executed
notebooks, extracted code) for multiple audiences (students, solutions,
speaker notes).

**Version**: 1.12.0 | **License**: MIT | **Python**: 3.12, 3.13, 3.14

## Architecture

Four-layer architecture with an SQLite job queue and Direct/Docker worker
execution. Full details in `docs/developer-guide/architecture.md`.

```
clm/
├── core/           # Domain logic (Course, Section, Topic, CourseFile)
├── infrastructure/ # Job queue, worker management, backends, LLM client
├── workers/        # Worker implementations (notebook, plantuml, drawio)
└── cli/            # Command-line interface
```

Optional extensions live alongside this core: `clm.notebooks` (slide
utilities), `clm.slides` (authoring tools), `clm.mcp` (MCP server),
`clm.voiceover` (video pipeline), `clm.recordings` (recording workflow). See
the "Extended Modules" section of `architecture.md` for entry points.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .                  # core only
pip install -e ".[all]"           # everything (recommended for development)
```

For the full list of optional extras (`[notebook]`, `[plantuml]`, `[drawio]`,
`[all-workers]`, `[recordings]`, `[summarize]`, `[voiceover]`, `[slides]`,
`[gcal]`, `[mcp]`, `[ml]`, `[dev]`, `[tui]`, `[web]`) see
`docs/user-guide/installation.md`.

## Testing

```bash
pytest                    # Fast suite only (~72s; runs on the pre-PUSH hook)
pytest -m "not docker"    # Full suite minus Docker tests (~2 min, pre-release gate)
pytest -m ""              # Everything including docker/slow/integration/e2e
```

Tests run in parallel by default via `pytest-xdist` (`-n auto`). The fast
suite excludes `slow`, `integration`, `e2e`, `db_only`, and `docker` markers.
Docker-marked tests require CI-built images and are validated in CI only —
**use `pytest -m "not docker"` for pre-release local testing**. Full marker
list and strategy in `docs/developer-guide/testing.md`.

## Code Conventions

- **Type hints**: required for all public APIs.
- **Async/await**: preferred for I/O operations.
- **Dataclasses**: `attrs @define` for internal structures, Pydantic for
  messages crossing the worker/CLI boundary.
- **Logging**: `logging.getLogger(__name__)` — never `print()` in library code.
- **Scripts and tooling wrappers**: prefer Python over bash. CLM is a
  Windows-first project and the rest of the toolchain is Python — a `.py`
  script runs identically on Windows/Linux/macOS without depending on Git
  Bash being on PATH, and benefits from the same ruff/mypy checks as the
  rest of the codebase. Reach for bash only when a shell-specific feature
  is genuinely required and the script will never run on Windows.

## Info Topics Maintenance Rule (CRITICAL)

The `clm info <topic>` command outputs version-accurate markdown documentation
that **downstream agents in course repositories rely on** to understand CLM's
current behavior. The content lives in `src/clm/cli/info_topics/*.md` and uses
`{version}` placeholders replaced at output time.

**When you change CLM behavior that affects how course repositories are
structured or built, you MUST update the corresponding info topic.**

| Change | Info topic to update |
|---|---|
| Spec file format (elements, attributes, defaults) | `src/clm/cli/info_topics/spec-files.md` |
| CLI commands, flags, options | `src/clm/cli/info_topics/commands.md` |
| Breaking changes, migration steps | `src/clm/cli/info_topics/migration.md` |

If the info topics are stale, downstream agents will produce incorrect output.
Keeping these files current is as important as updating tests. Do not
hardcode version numbers — use `{version}`.

## Changelog Entries

Never edit the `## [Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` in a PR — every
concurrent PR inserting there made changelog merge conflicts near-universal.
Instead, add a fragment file `changelog.d/<pr-or-issue>-<slug>.<type>.md`
(type = `added` | `changed` | `deprecated` | `removed` | `fixed` |
`security`) containing the finished markdown bullet(s). Fragments are folded
into `CHANGELOG.md` at release time by `python scripts/collect_changelog.py
X.Y.Z`. Conventions: `changelog.d/README.md`.

## Release Rules

Full procedure lives in `docs/developer-guide/releasing.md`. The hard rules:

- **Never publish a release without updating documentation first.**
- **Never publish a release if any local test fails.**
- **Never publish unless CI has passed for the tagged commit.**
- Use `pytest -m "not docker"` for local pre-release testing (Docker tests
  run in CI only).
- **Publishing is automated — do not run `uv publish` / `gh release create` by
  hand.** Landing a `Bump version …` commit on `master` (e.g. merging a bump PR
  with a **merge commit**, not squash/rebase) — or pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag —
  triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which gates on CI being green for
  that commit, then publishes to PyPI via OIDC Trusted Publishing and creates
  the GitHub Release. Your job is the docs + CHANGELOG + version bump; the
  workflow does the rest. (A manual fallback is documented in `releasing.md`.)

## Git Workflow

- Branch prefix: `claude/` for AI-generated branches.
- **Commit, push, and open PRs autonomously — do not wait for a go-ahead.**
  When a task is finished (in particular after a significant chunk of work is
  committed), push the branch without asking. When a feature or bugfix is
  complete and you are working in a worktree, create a Pull Request without
  asking for permission. Asking is only warranted for genuinely destructive
  operations (force-push to a shared branch, history rewrites) or pushes to
  `master` itself.
- **Git hooks**: install with `uv run pre-commit install` (wires up both hook
  types via `default_install_hook_types`). The **pre-commit** hook runs ruff +
  mypy (fast, every commit); the **pre-push** hook runs the fast test suite
  (~72s) on `git push`. So commits are near-instant and the test gate fires once
  before a push. Re-run `pre-commit install` if you set up hooks before the
  pre-push split landed.
- Manual checks: `uv run ruff check src/ tests/` and
  `uv run ruff format src/ tests/`.
- Commits that fail a hook did **not** happen — fix the issue, re-stage, and
  create a **new** commit. Never `--amend` a commit the hook rejected.
- **`master` belongs to the main repo — a worktree must NEVER switch to it.**
  The `master` branch is checked out in the main repo (`C:/…/Projects/clm`), and
  Git forbids the *same* branch being checked out in two worktrees at once (no
  config changes this). So a worktree never runs `git switch master` /
  `git checkout master` — that command can only fail or, if forced, corrupt the
  main checkout. To put a worktree on the latest master **content**, reset the
  worktree's **own** branch onto `origin/master` instead. From inside the
  worktree:
  ```
  git fetch origin && git switch -C <worktree-branch> origin/master
  ```
  This keeps you on your per-worktree branch (e.g. `worktree-<name>`) with
  master's exact tree — non-destructive when that branch is already merged/behind.
  To start fresh work, branch off it: `git switch -c claude/issue-NNN-...`.
  **Never** set `core.bare=true` on the main repo to "free up" `master` — that
  strips the main checkout's working tree and is a recurring source of breakage.

| Testing markers & strategy | `docs/developer-guide/testing.md` |
| Release procedure (full steps) | `docs/developer-guide/releasing.md` |
| Recording workflow & backends | `docs/user-guide/recordings.md`, `recordings-auphonic.md` |
| Voiceover pipeline | `docs/user-guide/voiceover.md` |
| Troubleshooting | `docs/user-guide/troubleshooting.md` |
| Known issues / bugs / TODOs | `docs/claude/TODO.md` |
| AI assistant design docs | `docs/claude/design/` |

**Before proposing changes to code**, read the file first. **Before
recommending a command or flag**, verify it exists in `clm info commands` —
do not fabricate options.

## Troubleshooting Quick Hits

1. **Tests failing**: check external tools (PlantUML JAR, Draw.io executable)
   and enable logging with `CLM_ENABLE_TEST_LOGGING=1`.
2. **Worker issues**: run `python diagnose_workers.py`.
3. **Import errors**: ensure `pip install -e .` was run in the correct
   environment.
